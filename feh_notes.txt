man feh

     -q, --quiet
      Don't report non-fatal errors for failed loads.  Verbose and quiet modes are not mutually exclusive, the first controls informational messages, the second only er‐ rors.
`
     -r, --recursive
      Recursively expand any directories in the command line arguments to the content of those directories, all the way down to the bottom level.

     -F, --fullscreen
      Make the window fullscreen.  Note that in this mode, large images will always be scaled down to fit the screen, and --zoom zoom only affects smaller images and never scales larger than necessary to fit the screen size.  The only exception is a zoom of 100, in which case images will always be shown at 100% zoom.

      When combined with --thumbnails, this option only affects images opened from the thumbnail overview.  The thumbnail list itself will still be windowed.

     -Y, --hide-pointer
      Hide the pointer (useful for slideshows).
`
     -D, --slideshow-delay float
      For slideshow mode, wait float seconds between automatically changing slides.  Useful for presentations.  Specify a negative number to set the delay (which will then be float * (-1)), but start feh in paused mode.

     -R, --reload int
      Reload filelist and current image after int seconds.  Useful for viewing HTTP web‐ cams or frequently changing directories.  (Note that filelist reloading is still experimental.) Set to zero to disable any kind of automatic reloading.

      If an image is removed, feh will either show the next one or quit.  However, if an image still exists, but can no longer be loaded, feh will continue to try loading it.

      Setting this option causes inotify-based auto-reload to be disabled.  Reload is not supported in montage, index, or thumbnail mode.
